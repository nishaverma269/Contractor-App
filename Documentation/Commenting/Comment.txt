Comments are located at the top of each .js file that 
explains what the controller does and why we are using it. 

If there is a service in any of the controllers, we also explain what that is used for with a 
comment at the top of the service, such as CommonProp being used for keeping track of an 
authenticated user between web pages. 

Functions in each .js file also include what they are used for, how they are called, which is 
generally through a directive like ng-click, and what the result of the function should be 
and if it should affect the view. 

Each HTML file includes comments in places that may need explaining, such as a button 
that calls ng-click for a function, or where important functionality of the HTML is run. 

Testing files are generally self described since they are located in the same folder as the 
functions they are testing. The 'describes' for each test file explain what the unit tests 
or end-to-end tests are being done and the 'it' describes a specific case being tested.
