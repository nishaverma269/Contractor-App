Testing is done using KARMA and JASMINE.

Karma is a JavaScript command line tool that can be used to spawn a web server 
which loads your application's source code and executes your tests.

Jasmine is a behavior driven development framework for JavaScript that has become the 
most popular choice for testing AngularJS applications.

We will be follow the testing tutorial and standards set by
https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing

Also. following the coding conventions set by
https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-style-guide/blob/master/README.md

Testing files for unit testing are located in the same directories as the code it is testing 
and has the same ending as the name of the .js file that holds our controller with Test added
at the end. 

Testing files for End-to-End testinga are located within the e2e-tests directory and the tests
are within scenarios.
