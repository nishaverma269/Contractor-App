If not using Linux, will be using the desktop app provided by GitHub, which is called GitHub 
Desktop.

https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/ - Helps with installing and making
sure GitHub Desktop is setup correctly. 

https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/ - Helps with how to contribute to a 
GitHub project using GitHub Desktop. 

The general idea of how to use GitHub Desktop:
1. Find the project you are working on their official website. 

2. Open it in GitHub Desktop by going to Clone and Download and opening it on the
desktop. This will add the project to your GitHub Desktop list of projects.
 
3. From this, you can open up the location of your project structure by right clicking
on the project on GitHub Desktop and selecting Open in Explorer

4. Any changes to this directory will reflect in the application and changes can be added 
by first commiting the changes with a description of what you are adding and clicking the Sync
button in the top right corner that will sync the new changes along with any new changes by other 
users on the website. You push new changes to branches instead by clicking on the button next 
to the master dropdown menu and adding new ones or finding an existing one. 


https://guides.github.com/ is a good reference for how to use GitHub as well.
